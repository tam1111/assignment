    <section class="s12"><h2>Branches & Commit</h2><img class="b1" src="b1.png" alt="b2">
        <p>As I’ve worked on this assignment, I have faced a few challenges and the first one was the commits and branches. I tried to revert a commit and when I did my code stopped working and I wasn’t sure why I spent about 30 min trying to fix it before I gave up and started everything all over again. It didn’t take me long before I was back on track as I just copied and pasted parts of the code back for my new fresh start.</p></section>
        <section class="s22"><h2>Keyframe Animation</h2><img class="b2" src="b2.png" alt="b2">
        <p>Another challenge I came across during my progress in this assignment was when my key frame animation wouldn’t stop on the last frame at first when I googled it I couldn’t get it to work after a while I came across a conversation on stack overflow where a guy mentioned that you need to implement the code “forwards” and that’s how I worked it out.</p></section>
        <section class="s32"><h2>CSS</h2><img class="b3" src="b3.png" alt="b3">
        <p>The last main challenge I came across was the CSS I was getting confused putting everything on one CSS, so I split them into two which helped as it made things clearer for me and it helped me work quicker.</p></section>
